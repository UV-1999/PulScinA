# PulScinA
Pulsar Scintillation Analysis Pipeline

These Python scrtpts are aspires to be a pulsar scintillometry data analysis pipeline for GMRT and ORT data under the guidance of Dr. Jaikhomba Singha and Prof. Bhal Chandra Joshi.
An usable package will be uploaded here soon. The scripts here are stand-alone programs and require PSRCHIVE installed in the system, to run.
